# Advertising_Sales_Prediction
This project focuses on predicting sales based on advertising budgets across three channels: TV, radio, and newspapers, utilizing various regression techniques in R. The dataset consists of historical advertising expenditures and corresponding sales figures, enabling us to analyze relationships and derive insights. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model training using linear regression, Lasso regression, and Random Forest models. Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as RMSE and R-squared, alongside techniques like cross-validation and bootstrapping to ensure robustness. Additionally, a Plumber API is implemented, allowing users to make real-time predictions by providing advertising budget inputs. This comprehensive approach aims to offer a data-driven tool for businesses to optimize their advertising strategies and forecast sales effectively.
